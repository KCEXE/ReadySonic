# ReadySonic
This is a mirror of Devin "Mercury" Reeves's *ReadySonic*; a modified [split disassembly](http://segaretro.org/Disassembly) of *Sonic 1*, based on [Sonic Retro's SVN version](http://svn.sonicretro.org/listing.php?repname=CommunityDisassemblies).

The intent of *ReadySonic* is to make starting a new hack of *Sonic 1* easier. The original ROM as released by Sega contains a handful of bugs, and lacks some popular features (such as the spin dash) from later games in the series. Every time a hacker wishes to hack the game, they have to solve each of these issues from scratch, which wastes valuable time. In fact, most hackers don't bother to fix all of the original's glitches.

So, if you want to hack Sonic 1, consider using *ReadySonic* as your template. Almost all of the changes Mercury has made are voluntary ("Elective Mods"): they can be toggled on and off by setting flags in the "(Mercury) Fixes.asm" file. Some of the changes are obvious bugfixes that he couldn't imagine anyone not wanting the benefit of ("Permanent Mods"); these fixes cannot be easily turned off, but of course reverting to the original code is as easy as copying and pasting from a clean disassembly of the original.
